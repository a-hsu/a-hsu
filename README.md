### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
Hello there! My name is Andrew Hsu, and this is my Github intro page. I am a Software Engineer based in New York, and I am passionate about working across the stack to deliver cool features for your products.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning AWS services and TailwindCSS
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/a-hsu)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I was a fencer for 9 years and it was definitely not because I was obsessed with Star Wars as a kid...

## Projects
Here are some of the projects I have been working on:

- [GetSnapped.gg](https://github.com/getsnappedgg/getsnapped-web): A deck builder third party tool for the mobile game Marvel Snap
- [MonkeypoxViz](https://github.com/MPXVIZ/monkeypox-data-viz): A server that populates a redis store with monkeypox cases from a separate repository, and returns it to a client.
